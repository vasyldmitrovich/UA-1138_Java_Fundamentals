The sun sets on the horizon.
Nights are peaceful under the moonlight.
The river flows gently, carrying secrets of the land.
Dawn breaks, bringing new beginnings.
The cat chased the mouse.
Elephants eat bananas.
Apples and oranges are fruits.
Rabbits hop quickly.
Ohio is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States.
